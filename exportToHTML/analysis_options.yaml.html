<pre><span class="s0"># This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to</span>
<span class="s0"># check for errors, warnings, and lints.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled</span>
<span class="s0"># IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be</span>
<span class="s0"># invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.</span>

<span class="s0"># packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.</span>
